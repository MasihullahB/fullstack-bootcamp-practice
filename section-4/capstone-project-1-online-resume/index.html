        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          With a passion for cutting-edge technology and a commitment to
          continuously expand my knowledge, I am a driven and dynamic
          professional dedicated to achieving success for my organization. My
          proficiency in a broad range of modern and classic programming
          languages, including JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Power Platform
          (PowerApp and Power Automate), makes me a valuable asset to any team
          seeking a talented Frontend SharePoint Developer or a Power Platform
          Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a career break from July 2022 to March 2023 to spend time with
          my family and refresh my React, SharePoint and Power Platform skills,
          I am excited to bring my updated skills and dedication to a new role.
